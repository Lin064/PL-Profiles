In this grid-based puzzle game, the player controls a robot to navigate through nodes and unlock locks using keys. The keys and locks are represented by specific shapes such as circles, triangles, squares, and diamonds, with each key capable of unlocking a lock of the same shape. The robot can move between connected nodes, pick up keys, and use them to unlock corresponding locks.
